# Football Predictor Pro 🏆

A machine learning-based football match prediction system for Premier League matches, built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Overview

Football Predictor Pro uses historical match data and advanced statistics to predict the outcomes of Premier League football matches. The system considers various factors including team form, head-to-head records, and other relevant metrics to make predictions.

## Features

- **Match Outcome Prediction**: Predict win/draw/loss probabilities for any Premier League match
- **Historical Analysis**: Analyze team performance and historical trends
- **Advanced Statistics**: Track form, goal scoring patterns, and team metrics
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- **Model Performance Metrics**: View and analyze prediction accuracy
